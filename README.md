# About me




- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on experimental discovery of catalytic reactions, led by mechanistic investigations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML approaches to optimize catalytic reaction yields and selectivity, and predict chemical properties of structures.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in digital chemistry, particularly where data science meets organic synthesis and catalysis.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with accessing and utilizing large datasets for ML in small molecule SAR and physicochemical property prediction.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about homogeneous catalysis, DFT, digital chemistry tools, and tips for reaction optimization.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: check my profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m a synthetic chemist by day and an Audible addict by night. When Iâ€™m not in the lab, I love exploring Switzerland with my family or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
